  Pound is tic-tac-toe right? A sea of waiters and no one will take a drink order. For there's a man inside me, and only when he's finally out, can I walk free of pain. She's not that Mexican, Mom. She's my Mexican. And she's Columbian or something. I mean, it's one banana, Michael. What could it cost, ten dollars? Douche chill! She calls it a mayonegg.

I'd rather be dead in California than alive in Arizona. The worst that could happen is that I could spill coffee all over this $3,000 suit. COME ON. Mom always taught us to curl up in a ball and remain motionless when confronted. Suddenly he's too much of a big-shot to brush mother's hair. I know, I just call her Annabelle cause she's shaped like a…she's the belle of the ball! What do you think about Sudden Valley? It sounds like a salad dressing, but for some reason I don't want to eat it. And don't make the water too hot. The scabs come right off. I made a huge tiny mistake.

Go ahead, touch the Cornballer. I've been in the film business for a while but I just can't seem to get one in the can. Never once touched my per diem. I'd go to Craft Service, get some raw veggies, bacon, Cup-A-Soup…baby, I got a stew goin'. They frame my junk. Hey, it was one night of wild passion! Michael: And yet you didn't notice her body? Gob: I like to look in the mirror.

What do you think about Sudden Valley? It sounds like a salad dressing, but for some reason I don't want to eat it. In fact, it was a box of Oscar's legally obtained medical marijuana. Primo bud. Real sticky weed.

Dead Dove DO NOT EAT. Stop it, stop it. This objectification of women has to stop. Michael: It's just Mom and whores.

Probably out there without a flipper, swimming around in a circle, freaking out his whole family. They want to break his legs. It's a good thing he's already got that little scooter. ♪♪ It ain't easy being white. It ain't easy being brown. ♪♪ Why are you squeezing me with your body? Douche chill!

If I make this comeback, I'll buy you a hundred George Michaels that you can teach to drive! Never once touched my per diem. I'd go to Craft Service, get some raw veggies, bacon, Cup-A-Soup…baby, I got a stew goin'. Pound is tic-tac-toe right? One of the guys told me to take my head out of my BOTTOM and get back to work…my BOTTOM! A-coodle-doodle-doo. A-coodle-doodle-doo.

I spent so much time making sweet love on my wife that it's hard to hear anything over the clatter of her breasts. Someone order 140 pounds of upper body strength? It's as Ann as the nose on plain's face. I've always been deeply passionate about nature. Perhaps you remember Neuterfest? Wine only turns to alcohol if you let it sit.

Do you have any idea how often you say the word "afraid"? Well, I know I used it in the Jacuzzi. She wanted to look 48. I nearly airbrushed her into oblivion. Ended up checking "albino" on the form. Maybe it was the other George Michael. You know, the singer-songwriter. So did you see the new Poof? His name's Gary and we don't need anymore lawsuits. We all need to pick a day to try and make trend.

Mister gay is bleeding! Mister gay! You're Killing Me, Buster. YOU'RE the Chiclet! Not me. Caw ca caw, caw ca caw, caw ca caw! That coat costs more than your house! If mother sees this, she will blow a cow. God knows they're squinters.
