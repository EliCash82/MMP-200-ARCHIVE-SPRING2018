*WARNINGS:*
* If an image or any other media asset is presented in the midterm without any form
of citation, it will be treated as if it has not been included. (This is for non-original media only, original media created by student does not require citation)
* If a quote is used (I.E. cutting and pasting from Wikipedia) and no citation given, I
will know, and depending on the severity, you may be given a grade of 0 on your Midterm... *PLAGIARISM IS NOT TOLERATED IN THIS CLASS!*

### Final Project

* **SITE MUST BE RESPONSIVE**: This means you must either utilize the grid
system provided by twitter bootstrap or use another option like *Foundation* or
*CSS Grid*

* **SITE MUST HAVE UNIQUE EXTERNAL CSS STYLESHEET**: You must construct your own
unique CSS stylesheet.

* **SITE MUST HAVE UNIQUE COLOR SCHEME**: On your unique stylesheet I want
to see that you understand *HEX CODES* and the importance of a standardized
color scheme.  This can be minimal (You can just use black and white, but I
  need to see)

* **SITE MUST USE AT LEAST TWO DIFFERENT FONTS**: You could have one font for
headers and another font for the body text... it really doesn't matter, I just
need to see that you can integrate multiple fonts into your final product.

* **SITE MUST HAVE IMAGES**: Images should be present, and their placement should
make sense.  Full credit requires an understanding of proper aspect ratios.  Any
images that are not original must link back to their original source.

* **SITE MUST HAVE AT MINIMUM 4 HTML PAGES**: And yes, all four pages should
have unique content.

* **SITE SHOULD HAVE A UNIQUE LOGO**: This can be big or small, just a unique
font or a unique drawing/image.  No logos should use characters or ideas
under copyright.

* **SITE SHOULD BE ENJOYABLE TO READ**: I will not be grading the writing as
harshly as the midterm, however, I will be looking for correct spelling and will
be checking to make sure what is written on your site is not plagarized.  I will
not give an exact word count, but if you have less than 1000 words you can bet
that you would be wise to write more (unless you've gone the extra mile with unique
image, audio, or video assets).
