### Homework 8; DUE 4-26-18

Find a website (Feel free to use one of the example sites you cited in your Midterm Proposal) with a color scheme that you like. Identify at least 8 different colors.  Take a screenshot of the site and use Photoshop or Gimp 'color picker tool' for color identification.  Create an HTML page with an external CSS stylesheet where all eight colors are given a name.  Make a div for each of the colors, and submit by e-mail by due date.  

Here is an Example:

  ```HTML

<h1> Color Swatch taken from WEBSITE.COM</h1>

<h2>COLORS</h2>

  <div class="color-a">
    <h2>1. BLUE-GREEN</h2>
  </div>
  ```

  ```CSS
.color-a {
  background-color: #6AFFB1;
  color: white;
}
