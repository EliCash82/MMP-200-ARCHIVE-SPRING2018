### **UPDATE** 2-11-2018
I have uploaded the files created during our 2/18 class into the
folder `LAB-2-8-2018`, feel free to use this while trying to initiate
bootstrap navbar with working dropdown.

See updated **POINT 8** in the homework assignment below for proper
HW submission directions.

1. getbootstrap.com
2. click download bootstrap.
3. Extract Zipfile
4. Create Initial Hello World HTML + Bootstrap.CSS
5. link to external Bootstrap stylesheet
6. link to JQuery and Bootstrap Javascript

    * **TEXT EDITOR - HTML Page** with visible reference to your *original CSS stylesheet*, `bootstrap.js`, and `jquery-3.3.1.min.js`
