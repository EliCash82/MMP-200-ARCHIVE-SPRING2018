**Q: When do I use `class` and when do I use `id`?**

1. `id`s are unique identifiers - this means you can only use them once in your document.
2. Think of `id` like your social security number, you can only have one and it must be unique!
3. `class` works great as classifier
4. `class`es are not unique
5. You can have multiple `class`es per element. (Think of our bootstrap navbar -- `<nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-light bg-light">`)
6. `id` has higher priority than `class` - this means `id` will override conflicting `class` rules.
